#### About：
Raincore is a shader pack that captures the petrichor scent of moist earth after the rain, featuring distinct pixelated effects and grain/lo-fi.  
This is my fifth shader pack, built upon my previous work, [Lantern](https://modrinth.com/shader/lantern-shader). I hope you enjoy it! (^-^)

#### Performance：
No high-end hardware is required; integrated graphics are sufficient for a smooth experience.  
For the best visual balance, a render distance of 8 chunks is recommended. While you can go lower, it is best kept between 8 to 11 chunks.

#### FAQ：
- **Q**: Can I include this shader in my Modpack?
- **A**: Distributing this shader as part of a modpack without modifying its source code is not considered creating a derivative work. Other components of the modpack are not bound by the GPLv3 license.
